webpack/./src/app -> Path to our source files inside devTools

Typescript does not run in our browser.
What browser understands is only Javascript.

During the build process, Webpack converts these TS files to Javascript bundles.
So in DevTools where the Javascript bundles are run, how can we find the typescript code we've written to debug??

The converted Javascript code support sourcemaps. 

Sourcemaps are little addition, that our CLI add to our Javascript bundles, so that our browser can map the JS code with the TS code.

Sourcemaps are provided only in development mode and stripped out in production mode.
