<!-- 

app-root selector and bunch of javascript imported which while will be executed first when we starts the application with ng serve command.

the script executes our main.ts file 1st which indeed goes to our app.module.ts file, where Angular get all the information needed to load our application(i.e; what is app-root selector it found in index.html page)

Now, in app-module, the bootstraped component is app.component

So, it goes to app.component's template file i,e; app-component.html 

and Finally Angular is able to resolve the app-root selector. It replaces the app-root with the html content of app.component.html

<!-- 

Angular is used to make single page applications.

Unlike having multiple pages for multiple views in a multi-page applications,

Angular chnages the DOM at runtime to show different views. The single page we are talking about is nothing but the index.html page only.

It's the only page that is served and is changed at run time through the javascript code we injected on this file(index.html) after ng serve.

Summary:
What is Angular ?
Angular is a JS framework changing the DOM('HTML') at runtime.
